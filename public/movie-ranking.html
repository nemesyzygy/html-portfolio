<h1>The Best Movies According to Me</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Repo Man</h3>

<p>
	This is my favourite movie by far. It's wacky and crazy and is from the 80s
	which is my favourite decade/aesthetic.
</p>

<h3>Hell Dogs</h3>

<p>
	Full of action and violence and weird subtext. Instant classic for me and
	great acting.
</p>

<h3>Drive</h3>

<p>
	Such an aesthetic movie with beautiful cinematography. Plus Oscar Isaac is in
	it and he's awesome.
